## Intro

The structure of this intro is organized around the "Three Ways" which outline values & philosophies that guide DevOps processes & practices:

I. The First Way - accelerate the delivery of IT services with **Continuous Delivery** and using principles and practices that lead to an accelerated flow.

II. The Second Way - amplify feedback loops by creating a problem-solving culture, understand monitoring, monitoring business metrics, and changing how management applies DevOps.

III. The Third Way - patterns of organizational learning and safety culture that include blameless postmortems, resilience engineering, and systems thinking.
